This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation).
It scrapes the opening Hours and the Adresses of the amenities of the city Heilbronn(Germany) once per day, adds the coordinates from Google Maps and pushes the data into the data.sqlite file. Our project can be visited at recycling.gonam.de
If you have any questions about my code or if you need help with creating a nodejs Scraper at morph.io, just send me a message.
